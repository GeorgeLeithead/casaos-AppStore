A Free Software Media System That Puts You In Control Of Managing And Streaming Your Media. It Is An Alternative To The Proprietary Emby And Plex, To Provide Media From A Dedicated Server To End-user Devices Via Multiple Apps. Jellyfin Is Descended From Emby's 3.5.2 Release And Ported To The .net Core Framework To Enable Full Cross-platform Support. There Are No Strings Attached, No Premium Licenses Or Features, And No Hidden Agendas: Just A Team Who Want To Build Something Better And Work Together To Achieve It.
